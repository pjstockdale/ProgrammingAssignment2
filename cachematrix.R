## This package demonstrates closure semantics to enable the results of 
## expensive intermediate operations to be cached ahead of their computed need
##

## This function establishes the environment that will contain the cached
## object along with the functions and objects necessary to manage that cache

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function returns the results of the intermediate operation from the
## cache if the object has previously been computed or by computing the object

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
